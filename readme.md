# About

Updated from _SOH CARD 4201 activity (archived from test.ltc.bcit).  Modified to create the data from table in the body.

## Set up activity from template

The `sampleTemplate.html` provides the table structure needed.  
Copy the template html and replace table content.
First column are the questions, second column are the answers.
Selection component options will be from all the answers (duplicates will be combined so only unique choices)
