            Every consciously aware patient within the PICU may reasonably experience physical distress through invasive/painful procedures, pain crises from sources of admission or invasive medical equipment, and feelings of impending death/ instability. All of these ways of feeling "physically unsafe" are closely integrated into a lack of emotional safety.
